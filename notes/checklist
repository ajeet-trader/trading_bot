🧠 Module 1.3: Core Data Structures  - DONE
 Define memory-efficient custom classes for Signal, Trade, and Position objects using __slots__.

📊 Phase 2: Data Ingestion System  - DONE
Goal: Create a reliable pipeline to fetch, normalize, and store market data from multiple sources.

🔌 Module 2.1: API Adapters   - DONE
 Implement a base APIAdapter class.

 Create a YahooFinanceAdapter for fetching historical stock data.

 Create a CCXTAdapter for fetching historical and real-time crypto data (e.g., from Binance).

 Validation: Test each adapter to ensure it can connect, fetch, and return data in a standardized format.

⚙️ Module 2.2: Data Normalization & Quality   - DONE
 Implement a data normalization layer to ensure consistent column names (e.g., timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume).

 Add data quality checks to handle missing values (NaNs) and outliers.

 Validation: Test the normalization and quality checks with data from different sources.

💾 Module 2.3: Data Storage     - DONE
 Implement logic to save and retrieve data using the memory-efficient Parquet format.

 Create a data versioning system (e.g., naming files with date and version) to ensure reproducibility.

 Validation: Test the storage and retrieval process, ensuring data integrity and efficient read/write speeds.

📈 Phase 3: Strategy & Signal Layer   - DONE
Goal: Build the framework for defining and generating trading signals from various strategies.

🧱 Module 3.1: Strategy Framework   - DONE
 Create a base Strategy class that all other strategies will inherit from. It must define a common interface for generating signals.

 Implement signal logging to capture every generated signal with its context (strategy, timestamp, symbol).

 Validation: Test the base class to ensure the interface is enforceable.

📚 Module 3.2: Classic & Quant Strategies  - DONE
 Implement 3–5 classic strategies (e.g., EMA Crossover, RSI, Bollinger Bands).

 Implement 1–2 quantitative strategies (e.g., Mean Reversion, Momentum).

 Validation: Write unit tests for each strategy's logic to confirm correct signal generation based on sample data.

🧪 Phase 4: Backtesting System  - DONE
Goal: Develop a robust engine to test strategy performance on historical data.

🔁 Module 4.1: Backtesting Engine  - DONE
 Integrate backtesting.py into our framework within the /backtest module.

 Implement an event loop to feed historical data to the strategy layer.

 Validation: Run a simple benchmark strategy (e.g., buy and hold) and verify the results are as expected.

📉 Module 4.2: Performance Analytics  - DONE
 Implement calculation and reporting for key metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, CAGR.

 Add functionality to generate equity curve plots and trade reports.

 Validation: Verify metric calculations against a known, simple dataset and results.

🧬 Module 4.3: Optimization  - DONE
 Implement grid search for strategy parameter optimization.

 Implement walk-forward testing to validate strategy robustness and mitigate overfitting.

 Validation: Run an optimization and walk-forward test, analyzing the reports for logical consistency.

🤖 Phase 5: AI & Machine Learning Engine - WIP
Goal: Integrate predictive models to enhance signal generation.

🧱 Module 5.1: Feature Engineering  - DONE
 Create a feature generation pipeline (e.g., technical indicators, time-based features, lagged values).

 Validation: Test the feature generation process for correctness and consistency.

🎓 Module 5.2: Model Training & Registry
 Implement a training pipeline for an initial model (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).

 Implement a model registry to save, version, and load trained models.

 Validation: Train a model and test the save/load functionality, ensuring memory constraints are respected.

🧠 Module 5.3: AI-Driven Strategy
 Create a strategy that uses the trained ML model to generate signals.

 Implement confidence scoring for AI-based signals.

 Validation: Backtest the AI-driven strategy and analyze its performance report.

📟 Phase 6: Execution System
Goal: Build the components to simulate and (eventually) execute live trades.

🧪 Module 6.1: Paper Trading Engine
 Implement the paper_trader.py to simulate trade execution based on signals.

 Add models for slippage and commission costs.

 Validation: Run a backtest and have the paper trader execute the signals, comparing the final P&L.

📉 Module 6.2: Risk Management
 Implement position sizing logic (e.g., fixed fractional).

 Add system-level risk controls (e.g., circuit breakers to halt trading on large drawdowns).

 Validation: Test risk management rules in simulation to ensure they trigger correctly.

🛠️ Module 6.3: Live Integration (Future)
 Implement a live trading adapter (e.g., for Alpaca or Binance).

 Validation: Perform extensive testing in a sandboxed/paper-money live environment.

📊 Phase 7: Monitoring & Operations
Goal: Create tools for real-time monitoring and long-term maintenance.

📺 Module 7.1: Dashboard (Optional)
 Develop a simple Streamlit dashboard to display live positions, P&L, and recent signals.

 Validation: Test the dashboard with simulated live data.

🔁 Module 7.2: Auto-Retraining
 Design a framework for periodically retraining ML models on new data.

 Validation: Manually trigger and test the retraining cycle.

🚀 Module 7.3: Deployment
 Create a main.py CLI to run the bot in different modes (backtest, live).

 Write a README.md with setup and usage instructions.

 Validation: Test the CLI and installation process from a clean environment.

📌 Implementation Rules
✅ Sequential Validation: Each module must pass its validation tests before we begin development on any module that depends on it.

✅ Resource Monitoring: We will continuously monitor RAM and CPU usage during all tests to ensure we stay within our 8GB limit.

✅ Documentation: Each module will be documented with its purpose and API before we consider it complete.
