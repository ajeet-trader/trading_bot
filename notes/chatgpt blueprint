store_data() → as CSV/SQLite

📁 Folders:
data/raw/

data/processed/

✅ Testing:
Test main.py fetches valid OHLCV for 2 symbols (e.g. BTC/USDT, EURUSD=X)

Check CSVs or SQLite files saved correctly

Validate column structure: timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume

📊 PHASE 2: Strategy Engine (50+ Strategies)
✅ Goal: Modular, plug-in strategy layer with signal logic

🔧 Core Base:
BaseStrategy class

run(df) → returns signals (entry/exit)

generate_signals() logic

Strategy parameters from YAML or Python dict

🔢 Strategy Types:
✅ Classic: EMA Crossover, RSI, MACD, BB, Stoch, Engulfing

🧠 Quant: Mean Reversion, Momentum, Seasonality

🤖 ML: Model-based strategies (later)

⚙️ Configurable: TP, SL, Risk-Reward, Position Sizing

📁 Folder:
strategies/ema_crossover.py

strategies/rsi_engulfing.py

etc.

✅ Testing:
Run strategy.run(df) → check returned signals

Confirm signal logs (BUY/SELL) are correctly aligned with candle timestamps

Plot signals on price chart to visually validate

📈 PHASE 3: Backtesting Framework
✅ Goal: Run multi-symbol, multi-strategy backtests efficiently

🧰 Libraries:
backtesting, backtrader, or lightweight custom engine

🔧 Modules:
BacktestRunner class

load_strategy()

run_backtest(symbol, strategy, params)

get_metrics(): Sharpe, Win%, Max DD, CAGR, Expectancy, etc.

walk_forward_test()

parameter_grid_search()

📁 Folder:
backtest/core.py

backtest/results/

✅ Testing:
Backtest 2 strategies on 1 symbol for 6 months

Compare metrics across runs

Confirm backtest logs (entry, exit, PnL) saved properly

🤖 PHASE 4: ML Engine
✅ Goal: Train models to predict future TP/SL outcomes or direction

🔧 Modules:
feature_generator() → RSI, MACD, Lag features, regime detection

train_model(X, y)

evaluate_model()

save_model(), load_model()

Model registry with versioning

🤖 Models:
Scikit-learn: RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM

TensorFlow Lite (for RAM-efficiency)

Clustering: KMeans/GMM for market regimes

📁 Folder:
ai_models/

ai_models/features/

ai_models/models/

✅ Testing:
Train model on 6 months BTC 5min data → predict next candle up/down

Save and reload model

Evaluate accuracy, precision, F1-score

🧠 PHASE 5: Signal Engine
✅ Goal: Combine Strategy + ML outputs → final signal

🔧 Modules:
SignalCombiner(strategy_signal, model_prediction)

signal_strength()

confidence_score()

📁 Folder:
live_signals/engine.py

✅ Testing:
Ensure signal engine gives BUY/SELL/HOLD with score

Output logs correctly

Compare strategy-only vs ML-enhanced accuracy

🛠️ PHASE 6: Execution Engine
✅ Goal: Simulate or execute trades (paper/live)

🔧 Modules:
PaperBroker(): simulate fills, TP/SL

LiveBroker() (Alpaca, Binance, OANDA plugin-ready)

simulate_slippage(), calculate_commissions()

Capital allocation, position sizing

📁 Folder:
execution/paper.py

execution/live.py

✅ Testing:
Paper simulate 5 trades from signals

Confirm PnL & trade log accuracy

Test TP/SL hit logic

📓 PHASE 7: Logger & Analytics
✅ Goal: Log every trade, signal, prediction with timestamp & outcome

🔧 Modules:
TradeLogger()

SignalLogger()

ErrorLogger()

Store as CSV, JSON, or SQLite

📁 Folder:
logs/signals/

logs/trades/

logs/errors/

✅ Testing:
Validate full history logs are written

Confirm trade outcome analysis works

Generate performance summary

📊 PHASE 8: Dashboard (Optional but Recommended)
✅ Goal: Real-time and historical insights via Streamlit UI

🔧 Features:
Symbol selector

Signal chart overlay

Strategy/ML comparison

Trade performance stats

Configurator for running strategies live

📁 Folder:
live_signals/dashboard.py

✅ Testing:
Run Streamlit app

Load signals & logs

Display charts and metrics

🔁 PHASE 9: Auto-Retraining & Optimization
✅ Goal: Periodic model retraining & strategy tuning

🔧 Tools:
Cron jobs or CLI scheduler

retrain_models()

optimize_parameters()

Compare past vs new performance

📁 Folder:
ai_models/retraining.py

backtest/optimize.py

✅ Testing:
Schedule retrain weekly

Save & log model performance versions

Auto-publish improved model

✅ HOW TO BUILD & TEST
✅ Build & test each phase/module independently

📂 Use main.py or individual test_*.py scripts for unit testing

✅ Once tested, integrate with other modules gradually

💾 All signals/trades must be logged and testable

🧪 Use 2–3 symbols (BTC, EURUSD, SPY) during dev/testing to avoid overload
