## 3. 🛠️ Installation & Setup: Get Ready to Go!

Let's get your powerful bot up and running! Follow these simple steps:

1.  **📥 Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with your bot's repo
    cd sapiens-ai-trading-bot # Navigate to your project folder
    ```

2.  **🐍 Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    (Highly recommended for managing dependencies cleanly!)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **📦 Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **🔑 API Key Configuration: Your Secret Stash!**
    *   Create a file named **`.env`** in your project's **root directory**.
    *   **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This file **MUST NOT** be committed to version control (`.gitignore` helps with this!).
    *   Add your API keys to this `.env` file. Replace the placeholders with your *actual* keys:
        ```
        # .env file - KEEP THIS FILE PRIVATE!
        ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY_HERE"
        BINANCE_API_KEY="YOUR_BINANCE_KEY_HERE"
        BINANCE_API_SECRET="YOUR_BINANCE_SECRET_HERE"
        ALPACA_API_KEY="YOUR_ALPACA_KEY_ID_HERE"
        ALPACA_API_SECRET="YOUR_ALPACA_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   Ensure your **`config.yaml`** (also in the root) references these environment variables for API keys. Our smart `config_loader` automatically pulls them from `.env` at runtime!

5.  **🚀 Initial Data Fetch & Model Training (Warm-Up Recommended!):**
    Before diving into backtests or live trading, let's get some data and train your first AI models.

    ```bash
    # 📈 Get Data & Run a Quick Backtest for AAPL (This fills your data folders!)
    python main.py backtest --strategy ema_crossover --symbol AAPL --interval 1d

    # 🧠 Train Your Initial AI Models for AAPL (Make sure you have AAPL data processed!)
    python ai_models/model_trainer.py
    ```

---

## 4. ▶️ Usage (CLI): Your Command Center

Your bot's power is at your fingertips! All commands are run from your project's **root directory** using `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py <command> [options]

## 5. 📁 Project Structure & File Reference: The Bot's Anatomy

Let's dissect your bot! This section details the purpose of each file, its typical output, and key dependencies for understanding modification impact. It also highlights **folder dependencies** – what you might need to consider if you add new files or modules within a directory.

### --- Root Directory: The Bot's Brain 🧠 ---

| File | Purpose | Sample Output / Side Effects | Modification Impact / Dependencies |
| :--- | :------ | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **`main.py`** | 👑 **Central Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for the entire bot. Acts as the main entry point, parsing commands and orchestrating calls to other modules (backtesting, retraining, live, dashboard). | - Prints command-specific status messages to console.<br>- Triggers processes that generate `logs/` entries, `backtest/results/` files, etc.<br>- Launches web browser for dashboard.<br>- Logs "Application starting up." to `logs/errors.log`. | - Depends on almost all top-level modules (e.g., `autotrain/retrainer.py`, `backtest/engine.py`, `execution/live_integration.py`).<br>- Changes to `argparse` configuration or command logic affect how the system is invoked.<br>- If strategy names or API key definitions change, this file might need updates to correctly parse arguments or initialize components. |
| **`config.yaml`** | ⚙️ **Global configuration file** defining system parameters, API key placeholders, instrument lists, strategy parameters, and risk management rules. | - No direct output. Consumed by many modules. | - Loaded by `utils/config_loader.py`.<br>- **High Impact:** Changes to parameters here affect the behavior of corresponding modules (e.g., changing `ema_crossover` parameters changes strategy behavior).<br>- If a section or key is renamed/removed, all modules reading that specific key must be updated. |
| **`.env`** | 🔒 **Secure storage for sensitive API keys and secrets.** Loaded by `config_loader` at runtime. | - No direct output. | - Loaded by `utils/config_loader.py`.<br>- **Security Critical:** This file should NEVER be committed to version control.<br>- Changes to key values here affect API access credentials.<br>- Changes to key *names* require corresponding updates in `config.yaml` and possibly modules that parse `config.yaml` values. |
| **`requirements.txt`** | 📦 **Lists all Python package dependencies** required for the project. | - No direct output. | - Used by `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>- Adding/removing libraries requires updating this file and corresponding `import` statements/code changes in modules using those libraries. |
| **`README.md`** | 📖 This project documentation file. | - No direct output. | - None (except its own accuracy!). |

| **`logger_setup.py`** | ✍️ **Configures and provides structured (JSON) logging** for the entire application. Creates separate log files for signals, trades, and errors with rotation. | - Creates and writes JSON-formatted log entries to `logs/signals.log`, `logs/trades.log`, and `logs/errors.log`.<br>- Prints messages to console during setup/testing. | - Depends on Python's built-in `logging` module, `json`, and `utils/config_loader.py`.<br>- **High Impact:** Used by virtually every other module for all logging. Changes to log format or file paths require careful coordination across the entire codebase. |
| **`data_structures.py`** | 📦 **Defines memory-efficient dataclasses** for core trading entities: `Signal`, `Trade`, and `Position`. Uses `__slots__` and `frozen=True` (where appropriate) for performance and data integrity. | - Returns instances of `Signal`, `Trade`, `Position`.<br>- Prints memory test results on direct execution. | - Depends on Python's `dataclasses` module.<br>- Used by `strategies/base_strategy.py`, `execution/paper_trader.py`, `execution/live_integration.py`.<br>- **High Impact:** Changes to these dataclasses (e.g., adding/removing fields, changing types) require updates in any module that creates or consumes instances of these objects. |

### --- `logs/`: The Audit Trail 📝 ---
This directory serves as the centralized location for all application logs.
*   **📝 Folder Dependencies (Adding new files):** If you create new log files (e.g., `performance_metrics.log`):
    *   You would need to define a new logger in `utils/logger_setup.py` to write to this file.
    *   `live_signals/dashboard.py` would need to be updated to display the content of this new log file.

| File | Purpose | Sample Output / Side Effects | Modification Impact / Dependencies |
| :--- | :------ | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **`signals.log`** | 🚦 **Stores structured JSON logs of all trading signals** generated by strategies. | - Contains a stream of JSON objects, each representing a BUY, SELL, or HOLD signal with its context (timestamp, symbol, strategy, price, confidence). | - Written to by `strategies/base_strategy.py` via `utils/logger_setup.py`.<br>- Read by `live_signals/dashboard.py` for display.<br>- Modifications to its format directly impact `base_strategy.py` and `dashboard.py`. |
| **`trades.log`** | 💸 **Stores structured JSON logs of all executed trades** (both simulated paper trades and live trades). | - Contains a stream of JSON objects, each representing a trade execution with details like action (BUY/SELL), quantity, price, and associated costs/confirmations. | - Written to by `execution/paper_trader.py` and `execution/live_integration.py` via `utils/logger_setup.py`.<br>- Read by `live_signals/dashboard.py` for display.<br>- Modifications to its format directly impact `paper_trader.py`, `live_integration.py`, and `dashboard.py`. |
| **`errors.log`** | ⚠️ **Stores structured JSON logs of all warnings, errors, and critical events** occurring within the application. | - Contains a stream of JSON objects, each representing an error, warning, or critical event, often with stack traces and additional context. | - Written to by many modules (e.g., `data/api_adapters/`, `data/data_processor.py`, `execution/risk_manager.py`, `autotrain/retrainer.py`) via `utils/logger_setup.py`.<br>- Read by `live_signals/dashboard.py` for display.<br>- Modifications to its format primarily impact `dashboard.py`. |
